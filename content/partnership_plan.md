# Fré Leys: LA 2028 Team & Sponsorship Plan

## 🎯 Core Objectives

This plan is designed to achieve three primary goals:

* **1. Performance Goal:** To secure the necessary financial, professional, and performance-based support to successfully train for and qualify for the LA 2028 Paralympics.
* **2. Advocacy Goal:** To build a dedicated team (of partners, sponsors, and professionals) to actively promote the **Paralympic Games of 2028** throughout **Leuven and Flanders**.
* **3. Legacy Goal:** To become the **first-ever Paralympian from Leuven**, using this personal journey as a platform to inspire the community and create lasting awareness for Paralympic sports.

This plan outlines the four key groups that will form this complete support system.

## 1. The Financial Partners

This group consists of two tiers of financial sponsors: a local base of support (Leuven Circle) and a national-level group of major partners.

### 1A. The Leuven Circle

* **Goal:** To create a stable financial base to cover all annual climbing-related costs and fund the communication campaign.
* **Target:** A core group of **8 partner companies**.
* **Profile:**
    * Leuven-based companies.
    * Primary focus on **engineering firms** to leverage my own background (PhD in Engineering).
* **Outreach:** A mix of warm outreach (existing network) and cold emailing.
* **Timeline:** Secure all 8 partners within the first 6 months of the campaign.
* **The Ask (Financial):**
    * A minimum of **€1,000 per year** per partner.
    * This ask will scale annually, rising to approximately **€1,500 per year** by the final year, as the campaign's value and visibility grow.
* **The Return (Negotiable):**
    * Official partner status with promotion on the `fre2028.LA` website and social media.
    * In-company talks (e.g., on performance, resilience, an engineer's approach to athletics).
    * Team-building activities, such as a climbing initiation.
* **Terms:** Partnerships will be structured for a yearly renewal. This builds in accountability, allowing me to prove the campaign's success each year. If a partner does not renew, a replacement will be sought.

### 1B. The Prime Partners (National Level)

* **Goal:** To secure major funding that allows me to **focus 100% on performance** in the final, critical year leading up to the Paralympics.
* **Target:** Approximately **4 very large partners**.
* **Profile:**
    * Major national (Flemish) companies.
    * Strong B2C (Business-to-Consumer) focus with a large customer base I wqnt to  reach.
    * Examples: Banks, supermarket chains, restaurant chains.
* **Outreach:** This will be a long-term strategic effort.
* **Timeline:** Secure all 4 partners by the **beginning of 2028**. This gives a ~2-year runway to build these high-level relationships.
* **The Ask (Financial):** Approximately **€10,000 each**.
* **The Return:**
    * High-level national visibility and association with the Belgian Paralympic story.
    * Inspirational talks for their national employee base.
    * Major brand alignment opportunities.
* **Challenge:** This is acknowledged as the most challenging part of the financial plan and will require a dedicated, professional approach.

## 2. Strategic Partners (Pro Bono Services)

* **Goal:** To acquire professional services and expertise to run the campaign effectively without direct financial cost, while simultaneously strengthening my Leuven network.
* **Target:** Leuven-based companies and skilled professionals.
* **Profile:**
    * Market research / analysis firm
    * Advertisement / PR agency
    * Professional content creators (videographer, photographer)
    * Legal or administrative support
