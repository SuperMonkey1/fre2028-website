## 3. Central Campaign Hub: `fre2028.LA`

The centerpiece of this campaign is my website, **fre2028.LA**. The `.LA` domain was chosen specifically to represent the host city of the 2028 Paralympics.

The website will be the primary hub for media, sponsors, and supporters, and will contain:
* My personal story
* This communication plan
* A showcase of my sponsors and "Team Fré"
* A portfolio (pictures, videos, podcasts, and other media)
* My competition results
* My monthly blog detailing the "obstacles, findings, and discoveries on my road towards LA 2028"
* A link to my non-profit: `Paraclimbing.be`

## 5. Campaign Timeline & Key Nodes

### PHASE 1: LEUVEN & COMMUNITY FOCUS

#### 📍 Node 1: 1000 Days Out (November 20, 2025) - CAMPAIGN LAUNCH
This node marks the official start, exactly 1000 days before the Paralympics.
* **Website Launch:** `fre2028.LA` goes live.
* **Media Launch:** Hold a press conference targeted specifically at **Leuven news media**.
* **Team building:** Officially begin building my team of partners (as described in a separate document [partnership_plan.md]).
* **Local Marketing:** Launch a "tiny" marketing campaign in Leuven as a practice run for the larger campaign later on.
* **Content Start:**
    * Launch the **monthly blog/newsletter**. (I will use my existing blog platform, which already has ~100 subscribers).
    * Begin regular, structured posting on social media (primarily **Instagram**, where I have ~5,000 followers, and Facebook).
* **Merchandise:** Begin the process of creating a logo to produce merchandise (t-shirts, hats).

#### 📍 Node 2: 900 Days Out - CLIMBING COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT
* **Action:** Launch the first episode of a 20-episode YouTube series: "**The Golden Fingers of Belgium**."
* **Concept:** I will invite 20 of the most famous Belgian climbers to test their finger strength on a standardized setup.
* **Features:** A running leaderboard will be maintained, and the winner will receive the "Golden Finger Trophy."
* **Goal:** Promote paraclimbing and the Paralympics directly to the Belgian climbing community.
* **Future Potential:** The test setup can later be used to tour Belgian climbing gyms, allowing all climbers to compare their strength against the participants. If successful, the series could be extended globally.

> **[Internal Note]:** By collaborating with famous climbers, I can reach a large segment of the climbing community for free by leveraging their existing platforms.

#### 📍 Node 3: 800 Days Out - EVENT HOSTING & DEVELOPMENT
* **Action:** Organize the **Belgian Paraclimbing Championship** (an open competition). This organisation will be a collaboration between my climbing club (BVKB from cilmbing gym "Klimax" and my non profit "paraclibming.be)
* **Date:** Planned for June 20-21.
* **Strategy:** We expect mainly international paraclimbers due to the small number of Belgian competitors. The event is strategically scheduled for the weekend **after** a large international paraclimbing competition in Austria, hoping climbers will "hop by" Belgium on their way home.
* **Two-Day Event Structure:**
    * **Day 1:** Climbing initiation for new Belgian paraclimbers.
    * **Day 2:** A para-routesetting course for Belgian routesetters, where the new paraclimbers can test the routes.

#### 📍 Node 4: 700 Days Out - LEUVEN CITY SATURATION
* **Action:** Launch a large-scale, focused promotional campaign in Leuven.
* **Tactics:**
    * Target local newspapers and magazines.
    * Hang posters in local shops.
    * Distribute brochures in mailboxes.
* **Goal:** To bring the people of Leuven into direct contact with the Paralympic movement, using my story as the "first Paralympian from Leuven" as the central narrative.
* **Specific Goal:** To make sure as many Leuven residents as possible can **recognize the Paralympic logo**, which is currently very unknown.
